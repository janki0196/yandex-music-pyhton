Introduction
Whenever we conduct research, we need to formulate hypotheses that we can then test. Sometimes we accept these hypotheses; other times, we reject them. To make the right decisions, a company must be able to understand whether it is making the correct assumptions.

In this project, you will compare the musical preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You will study real data from Yandex.Music to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior in these two cities.

Objective
Test three hypotheses:

User activity varies by day of the week and depending on the city.
On Monday mornings, the residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. The same is true for Friday evenings.
Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while in Shelbyville, there are more rap fans.
Stages
User behavior data is stored in the file /datasets/music_project_en.csv. There is no information about the data quality, so you will need to examine it before testing the hypotheses.

First, you will assess the data quality and see if the issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will address the most critical problems.

Your project will consist of three stages:

Data Description
Data Preprocessing
Hypothesis Testing
1. Data Description
Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Understand the columns and the type of data they contain.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.
Ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.
3. Hypothesis Testing
Analyze user activity by day of the week and city.
Compare genres listened to on Monday mornings and Friday evenings between the two cities.
Identify genre preferences for Springfield and Shelbyville and compare them.
